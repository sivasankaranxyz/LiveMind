# LiveMind

LiveMind - A web platform for building and managing live online classes. This project is done for my college mini project :)
Traditional education is the oldest form of delivering education to students through face to face interaction between teachers and students. 
The traditional education system needs to be revised in order to continue delivering education successfully in the present scenario which we called the digitized world. 
Online learning offer flexibility, affordable cost, and a variety of academic opportunities. 
In case of a pandemic the distance learners who want to experience learning on campus can enroll in the web platform where they can learn a courses, which blends classroom instruction with online learning with the help of live video teaching.
This project is about developing a digitized solution for the education system.
